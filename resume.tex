%I am a recent graduate from the University of Oregon computer science
%program, and am looking for a job in the local tech industry. My friends
%Andrew Bruce and Austin Lally have both encouraged me to apply for a
%position as a Django developer. I am also pleased to claim several
%aquantainces that work or have worked for Concentric Sky, and all of
%them have told me nothing but great things about your company.
%
%In addition to my general CS experience, I have spent the last two years
%working as a web developer for the University, and most of my time has
%been spent exploring Node.js and other exciting new web technologies. In
%that time, I have been a part of the team that produced the
%Student Guide mobile site, the lead developer for the renovated Outdoor
%Program web site, and lead/sole developer on several other minor
%projects.
%
%Although I have used python extensively in the past, I have only just
%recently begun exploring Django. I am quite excited to learn a new
%paradigm of web development; to learn new ways I can apply my
%experience.
%
%Thank you for your time.

    \item[EMU Marketing $\cdot$ Feb 2010 - current]\hfill \\
    I worked for nearly two years for the University of Oregon Student Union's
    Marketing department as a web developer on a small team. In my time
    there, I have developed several websites using some new and exciting
    web technologies, including Node.js and MongoDB. I have worked on
    both group and individual projects, instructed designers and new
    developers on the basic use of tools such as git and command-line
    interaction, and managed and maintained servers.
    %project involves building a web content management system in PHP.

    \item[OHSU Summer REU Program $\cdot$ Summer 2009]\hfill \\
    I spent Summer 2009 working as a paid intern of the Oregon Graduate
    Institute at Oregon Health and Science University. During my ten
    weeks in the program, I developed an ambitious python program which
    used finite-state transducers to improve the accuracy of a natural
    language parsing pipeline.
    %transformation-based learning system to improve parser accuracy in a
    %natural-language parsing pipeline. I used finite-state transducers
    %to improve the output of a particular stage in the pipeline, with
    %the intention of greatly improving accuracy down the line.
    I eventually co-wrote a paper on the system.

    \item[Buzz Monkey $\cdot$ June 2008 - June 2009] \hfill \\
    During the 2008-2009 school year, I worked as a paid design intern
    for a local video game studio.
    I worked with a total of four different teams on two different
    games, and was given the opportunity to experience both the Scrum
    and RAD development methodologies.
    %I had a great experience working as
    %part of several different teams with multiple different management,
    %organization, and meeting styles.
    %Currently hold a permanent position as a paid intern in the growing
    %design department; responsible for assistance in software
    %development and refinement. Was offered a position as a full-time
    %employee, but turned it down to continue my studies.  Internship is
    %currently extended indefinitely.
