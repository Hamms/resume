%I am a recent graduate from the University of Oregon computer science
%program, and am looking for a job in the local tech industry. My friends
%Andrew Bruce and Austin Lally have both encouraged me to apply for a
%position as a Django developer. I am also pleased to claim several
%aquantainces that work or have worked for Concentric Sky, and all of
%them have told me nothing but great things about your company.
%
%In addition to my general CS experience, I have spent the last two years
%working as a web developer for the University, and most of my time has
%been spent exploring Node.js and other exciting new web technologies. In
%that time, I have been a part of the team that produced the
%Student Guide mobile site, the lead developer for the renovated Outdoor
%Program web site, and lead/sole developer on several other minor
%projects.
%
%Although I have used python extensively in the past, I have only just
%recently begun exploring Django. I am quite excited to learn a new
%paradigm of web development; to learn new ways I can apply my
%experience.
%
%Thank you for your time.

  Paid Research Intern, \ Summer 2009

  \vspace{1em}

  I spent ten weeks working for the Oregon Graduate Institute at Oregon Health
  and Science University as part of their Research Experience for
  Undergraduates program.
  
  \vspace{1em}
  
  During my time there, I developed an ambitious python program which used
  finite-state transducers to improve the accuracy of a natural language
  parsing pipeline.

  \vspace{1em}

  I eventually co-wrote a paper on the system.
\end{topic}
  %transformation-based learning system to improve parser accuracy in a
  %natural-language parsing pipeline. I used finite-state transducers
  %to improve the output of a particular stage in the pipeline, with
  %the intention of greatly improving accuracy down the line.
