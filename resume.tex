%I am a recent graduate from the University of Oregon computer science
%program, and am looking for a job in the local tech industry. My friends
%Andrew Bruce and Austin Lally have both encouraged me to apply for a
%position as a Django developer. I am also pleased to claim several
%aquantainces that work or have worked for Concentric Sky, and all of
%them have told me nothing but great things about your company.
%
%In addition to my general CS experience, I have spent the last two years
%working as a web developer for the University, and most of my time has
%been spent exploring Node.js and other exciting new web technologies. In
%that time, I have been a part of the team that produced the
%Student Guide mobile site, the lead developer for the renovated Outdoor
%Program web site, and lead/sole developer on several other minor
%projects.
%
%Although I have used python extensively in the past, I have only just
%recently begun exploring Django. I am quite excited to learn a new
%paradigm of web development; to learn new ways I can apply my
%experience.
%
%Thank you for your time.

\section{Experience}

\begin{topic}{Hallspot}
    Lead Developer, \ May 2013 - present

    \vspace{1em}

    As the lead developer of a small startup, I had the
    opportunity to be involved in every phase of software development,
    from conception to implementation to support. We built a
    robust Flask API that powered mobile apps for both Android and iOS,
    as well as a web frontend written in Ember.js.

\begin{topic}{Concentric Sky}
    Web Developer, \ April 2010 - May 2013

    \vspace{1em}

    At Concentric Sky, I developed several websites using Django,
    Apache, Backbone.js, and many other popular web development tools. I
    also worked on some complex internal libraries relating to
    everything from automated form generation for hierarchically related
    models to a suite of search tools for database models.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{EMU Marketing}

  Web Developer, \ Feb 2010 - May 2012 

  \vspace{1em}
  
  In my time there, I developed several websites using some new and
  exciting web technologies, including Node.js and MongoDB. I had the
  opportunity to write low-level framework libraries and learned how to
  deal with complex, fully asynchronous systems.
\end{topic}

\begin{topic}{OHSU}
    Paid Research Intern, \ Summer 2009

    \vspace{1em}

    I spent ten weeks working for the Oregon Graduate Institute at
    Oregon Health and Science University as part of their Research
    Experience for Undergraduates program. I was able to develop an
    ambitious python program which used finite-state transducers to
    improve the accuracy of a natural language parsing pipeline, and
    eventually co-wrote a paper.
